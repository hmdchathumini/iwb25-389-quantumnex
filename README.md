# WorkNest

WorkNest is a Ballerina-powered web platform that connects customers with workers to get household tasks done easily. Customers can post jobs such as washing dishes, cleaning homes, painting walls, and more, while workers can browse available jobs, accept them, and get paid after completing the tasks. The platform provides a seamless workflow with three main dashboards: **Customer Dashboard**, **Worker Dashboard**, and **Admin Dashboard**.
